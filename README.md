This repo contains the team CampR's code output, dashboard, insights, models and datasets used in the [UN Big Data Hackathon 2022](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/events/2022/hackathon/).

The team worked on addressing The impact of Climate Change on society as part of monitoring SDG13 and how this links with people's opinions on climate action vs economic growth.
